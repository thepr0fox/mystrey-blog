      <h1>THE BOY IN THE BOX</h1>
      <p>Author: Vasim</p>

      <p>Joseph Augustus Zarelli (January 13, 1953 – February 1957), previously known as the "Boy in the Box", "Boy in a Box", or "America's Unknown Child", was an American 4-year-old boy whose naked, extensively beaten dead body was found on the side of Susquehanna Road, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 25, 1957. Joseph appeared to have been cleaned and freshly groomed, with a recent haircut and trimmed fingernails, although he had suffered extensive physical abuse prior to his death, with multiple bruises on his body. Joseph was also severely malnourished. The body was covered with scars, some of which were surgical (most notably on his ankle, groin, and chin). Authorities believe that the cause of death was homicide by blunt force trauma.</p>
      <p>Despite the publicity and sporadic interest throughout the years, the boy's identity remained unknown for over half a century. On November 30, 2022, the Philadelphia Police Department announced that detectives had determined the boy's identity using DNA and genealogical databases. On December 8, 2022, more than 65 years after his body was found, the boy was publicly identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli during a press conference held by Philadelphia Police Department.</p>

      <h2>Discovery of the body</h2>
      <p>On February 25, 1957, Zarelli's body, wrapped in a plaid blanket, was found in the woods off Susquehanna Road in Fox Chase, Philadelphia.The body was discovered by a young man who was checking his muskrat traps. Fearing that the police would confiscate his traps, he did not report what he had found.A few days later, a college student spotted a rabbit running into the underbrush. Knowing that there were animal traps in the area, he stopped his car to investigate and discovered the body. He was also reluctant to have any contact with the police, but he did report what he had found the following day, after hearing of the disappearance of Mary Jane Barker.

        The naked body was inside a cardboard box that had once contained a bassinet of the kind sold by J. C. Penney. Zarelli's hair had been recently cropped, possibly after death, as clumps of hair clung to the body. There were signs of severe malnourishment, as well as surgical scars on the ankle and groin, and an L-shaped scar under the chin.

      <h2>Investigation prior to identification</h2>
      <p>The police received the report and opened an investigation on February 26, 1957. The dead boy's fingerprints were taken, and police at first were optimistic that he would soon be identified. However, no one ever came forward with any useful information.</p>
      <p>The case attracted considerable media attention in Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed 400,000 flyers depicting the boy's likeness, which were sent out and posted across the area, and were included with every gas bill in Philadelphia. The crime scene was combed over and over again by 270 police academy recruits, who discovered a man's blue corduroy cap, a child's scarf, and a man's white handkerchief with the letter "G" in the corner; all clues that led nowhere. The police also distributed a post-mortem photograph of the boy fully dressed and in a seated position, as he may have looked in life, in the hope it might lead to a clue.
      </p>
      <p>In 1998, his body was exhumed for the purpose of extracting DNA, which was obtained from a tooth. On March 21, 2016, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released a forensic facial reconstruction of the victim and added him into their database. The body was then exhumed yet again in 2019 to retrieve additional DNA samples.</p>

   <h2>Theories prior to identification</h2>
    <p>This theory concerns a foster home that was located approximately 1.5 miles (2.5 km) from the site of the body.</p>
    <p>In 1960, Remington Bristow, an employee of the medical examiner's office who doggedly pursued the case until his death in 1993, contacted a New Jersey psychic, who told him to look for a house that matched the foster home. When the psychic was brought to the Philadelphia discovery site, she led Bristow directly to the foster home.</p>
    <p>Upon attending an estate sale at the foster home, Bristow discovered a bassinet similar to the one sold at J. C. Penney. He also discovered blankets hanging on the clothesline that were similar to the one in which the boy's body had been wrapped when they discovered him. Bristow believed that the boy belonged to the stepdaughter of the man who ran the foster home, and that they disposed of his body so the stepdaughter would not be exposed as an unwed mother.</p>

    <br>
    <p>However, the police established that all the foster children were accounted for, and a reexamination by police investigators confirmed that the family were likely not involved.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Philadelphia police lieutenant Tom Augustine, who was in charge of the investigation, and several members of the Vidocq Society (a group of retired policemen and profilers), interviewed the foster father and the stepdaughter (whom he had married). The foster home investigation was closed.</p>

    <h2>Burial</h2>
  <p>Joseph Augustus Zarelli was originally buried in a potter's field. In 1998, he was reburied at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Cedarbrook, Philadelphia, which donated a large plot. The coffin, headstone, and funeral service were donated by the son of the man who had buried the boy in 1957. There was significant public attendance and media coverage at the reburial. City residents keep the grave decorated with flowers and toys.</p>
  <p>The large headstone when first installed contained the words "America's Unknown Child", which was later changed to "Heavenly Father, Bless This Unknown Boy". On January 13, 2023, which would have been Joseph's 70th birthday, a new memorial containing his full name and image was unveiled, along with the addition of his name to the existing headstone.</p>

  <h2>Homicide investigation and developments following identification</h2>
  <p>At a December 2022 press conference, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Outlaw stated that Joseph's death is "still an active homicide investigation and we still need the public's help."Law enforcement reported at the same conference that both of Joseph's biological parents are deceased, but the child has living half-siblings</p>
<p>At the same December 2022 press conference, Philadelphia law enforcement stated that Joseph had lived in the area of 61st and Market streets."I don't know what the neighbors knew or didn't know," said the head of the Philadelphia police homicide unit, Captain Jason Smith, at the conference. "The child did live past the age of four years old, so there would have been somebody out there that would have seen this child, perhaps another family member that hasn't stepped forward, possibly a neighbor that remembers seeing that child, and remembers whatever was occurring at that particular household."</p>
<p>In January 2023, NBC10 Philadelphia reported that Joseph "was born to a couple that lived at 64th and Callowhill" although, the channel stated, it was "unclear if he lived there long enough for people to even notice him."</p>
