The "Little Miss Nobody" case is a decades-old unsolved mystery involving the unidentified remains of a young girl found in northern Arizona in 1960. Here is an overview of the case from beginning till now:

On July 31, 1960, a group of hikers discovered the partially decomposed remains of a young girl in a remote desert area near Williams, Arizona. The girl was estimated to be between 7 and 9 years old, about 4 feet 10 inches tall, and had light brown hair. She was wearing a yellow cotton dress and white sandals.

Despite extensive efforts by law enforcement, the girl's identity remained a mystery. She was buried in an unmarked grave in Williams' Citizens Cemetery, and her case became known as the "Little Miss Nobody" case.

Over the years, investigators used various methods to try and identify the girl, including creating facial reconstructions and distributing flyers and sketches of the girl. In 2008, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a new composite image of what the girl may have looked like at the time of her death, based on updated technology.

In 2014, the case received renewed attention when a retired police detective named John Leach began investigating it. Leach, who had worked on the case in the 1960s, had long been haunted by the mystery of Little Miss Nobody's identity. He created a Facebook page dedicated to the case and enlisted the help of forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick.

Using DNA extracted from the girl's remains, Fitzpatrick was able to create a genealogical profile and search through public DNA databases to find potential relatives. However, the investigation has yet to yield any concrete leads.

In 2021, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office announced that it had submitted the girl's DNA for advanced genetic testing in hopes of generating new leads. The testing involves sequencing the girl's entire genome, which could provide additional information about her ancestry and possible relatives.

Despite the ongoing efforts, Little Miss Nobody's identity remains a mystery. The case continues to be a source of fascination and frustration for investigators and the public alike, and the hope remains that one day the girl will be given a name and her killer brought to justice.
