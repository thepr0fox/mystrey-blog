            Murder of the Grimes sisters

            In December 1956, Barbara and Patricia Grimes went to see a screening of "Love Me Tender," an Elvis Presley movie, at the Brighton Theater in Chicago. They were last seen by a fellow theater-goer who reported that the sisters left the theater around 9:30 p.m.

The sisters had planned to take the bus home, but it's unclear whether they boarded it. Their mother became concerned when they did not return home, and she reported them missing to the police the following morning.

The case quickly gained national attention, and police received numerous tips from people claiming to have seen the girls. On January 22, 1957, a construction worker discovered the bodies of two young girls alongside a rural road near Willow Springs, Illinois, about 20 miles southwest of the theater where the sisters had been last seen.

The bodies were identified as those of Barbara and Patricia Grimes. The cause of death could not be determined due to the state of decomposition, but it was believed that the girls had been dead for several weeks. There were no obvious signs of violence or sexual assault, and the police were unable to find any useful physical evidence at the scene.

The investigation was one of the largest in Chicago's history, with over 1,000 officers working on the case. Despite this, no arrests were ever made, and the case remains unsolved to this day.

Over the years, numerous theories and suspects have been proposed, but none have been definitively proven. Some have suggested that the girls were kidnapped and killed by a serial killer, while others believe that they may have been the victims of a botched robbery or mistaken identity.

Despite the passage of time, the case remains open, and the Chicago Police Department has periodically reviewed the evidence in an effort to solve the mystery of the Grimes sisters' murders.
