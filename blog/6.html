      <h1>Murder of the Grimes sisters</h1>
      <p>Author: Anya</p>
<p>The Grimes sisters were two young American girls who were brutally murdered in Chicago in 1956. Barbara and Patricia Grimes were 15 and 12 years old respectively and were described as being inseparable sisters. They were both students and had recently joined the official fan club of Elvis Presley, whom they were devoted fans of. On December 28, 1956, the girls decided to go to the Brighton Park movie theater to watch Love Me Tender, the eleventh time they had seen the movie. They left their home at around 7:30 pm, promising their mother that they would return home before midnight. However, the girls never returned home, and their disappearance initiated one of the largest missing persons investigations in Chicago's history. </p>

      <p>The Brighton Theater was located approximately one-and-a-half miles from the girls' McKinley Park home, and they were presumed to have had approximately $2.50 in their possession at the time they left their home. It is unknown how the sisters traveled to the Brighton Theater on that particular night, although they had either walked or traveled by bus on previous occasions. During the film screening, the sisters were spotted by a school friend of Patricia named Dorothy Weinert, who was seated behind them with her younger sister. Weinert and her sister left the theater at the intermission of the double feature, at approximately 9:30 pm, and saw the Grimes sisters queueing to purchase popcorn. The girls seemed to be in good spirits, and there was nothing untoward in their behavior.</p>
<p>The sisters stayed to watch the second screening of Love Me Tender, meaning they would be expected to return home at around 11:45 pm. When the girls had not arrived home by midnight, their mother sent their older sister and brother to wait by the bus stop closest to their home for their arrival. After three successive buses had driven by without either girl alighting at the designated stop, both siblings returned home. Lorretta Grimes unsuccessfully tried to contact the girls' friends in the hope of finding her daughters, but to no avail. Finally, Lorretta Grimes filed a missing person report on her daughters with the Chicago Police Department at 2:15 am on December 29.

<p>The disappearance of the Grimes sisters initiated one of the largest missing persons investigations in the history of Cook County. Hundreds of police officers were assigned full-time to the search for the girls, and a task force was formed solely to locate them. A ground search initiated on December 29 was bolstered by hundreds of local volunteers, and police conducted door-to-door canvassing throughout Brighton Park. Numerous canals and rivers were dredged, and more than 15,000 flyers were distributed to local homes. The parishioners of the sisters' church offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Despite the massive search efforts, the girls' bodies were not discovered until January 22, 1957. They were found lying in a ditch alongside a deserted road in Willow Springs, Chicago, and both sisters were nude. The autopsy reports concluded that the girls had been murdered within five hours of their last confirmed sighting and that both had died of secondary shock. However, numerous individuals attested to having seen the girls alive in the weeks between the night of December 28 and the subsequent discovery of their bodies. </p>

<p>The murder of the Grimes sisters is one of Chicago's most infamous cold cases and remains unsolved to this day. The case is also acknowledged as one of the most labor-intensive missing person and murder investigations in Cook County. The Grimes sisters' murder shattered the innocence of Chicago, and the tragedy of their deaths has been felt by many. The family of the girls never got the closure they deserved, and the case still haunts the city of Chicago </p>
<p>In the weeks following the girls' disappearance, numerous individuals attested to having seen the girls alive in various locations throughout Chicago. For example, on December 31, two days after the girls were last seen, a waitress at a diner located approximately 10 miles from the Brighton Theater informed police two girls answering the description of the Grimes sisters had visited the diner with three young men on the night of their disappearance. The waitress attested to having personally served them, and further stated she had overheard one of the girls telling one of the young men she was 18 years old. When shown a photograph of the Grimes sisters, the waitress identified them as the girls she had served.</p>
<p>On January 22, 1957, a construction worker named Leonard Prescott discovered two bodies lying at the side of a deserted road in Willow Springs, some 16 miles southwest of Chicago.Prescott initially believed he had discovered two store mannequins, before realizing the truth.He immediately contacted police.Police soon identified the two girls as the Grimes sisters, and within hours, the spot where their bodies had been discovered was swarming with reporters, forensic experts, and police officers.</p>

The post-mortem examination of the Grimes sisters' bodies revealed both had died of "secondary shock" due to cold and exposure, and that both had been raped.The examination also concluded both girls had been murdered within five hours of their last confirmed sighting, and that both girls had been alive when they had been left at the roadside.Both sisters were nude when discovered, and there were no visible signs of external injury on either body.As a result of the girls' cause of death being secondary shock due to cold and exposure, the autopsy results could not pinpoint the exact time of their deaths, although it was concluded both had been dead for several weeks prior to their discovery.</p>
