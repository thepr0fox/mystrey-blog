          Theodore "Ted" Bundy was an American serial killer and rapist who was active in the 1970s. He confessed to the murders of 30 young women across several states and was executed in 1989.

          Here is a timeline of Bundy's crimes and legal proceedings:
          
          1974: Bundy begins his killing spree in Washington State, with the murders of young women who he lured into his car by feigning an injury and asking for their help. His first known victim was 18-year-old Karen Sparks. He then kills Lynda Ann Healy, Donna Gail Manson, Susan Elaine Rancourt, and Roberta Kathleen Parks.
          
          1975: Bundy moves to Utah and begins a new series of killings. He murders Melissa Anne Smith, Laura Aime, and Carol DaRonch, who was able to escape from Bundy's attempt to kidnap her.
          
          1975-1978: Bundy continues to travel and kill, with murders in Colorado, Idaho, and Florida. He uses various tactics to gain his victims' trust, such as posing as a police officer or a firefighter. Bundy's victims include Caryn Campbell, Denise Lynn Oliverson, Nancy Wilcox, Lisa Levy, Margaret Bowman, Kimberly Leach, and many others.
          
          1978: Bundy is arrested for the first time in Pensacola, Florida, after a police officer pulls him over and finds suspicious items in his car, including handcuffs and a crowbar. Bundy is charged with attempted kidnapping, but he manages to escape from jail by jumping out of a second-story window.
          
          1978: Bundy is arrested again in Jacksonville, Florida, after a routine traffic stop. He is charged with the murders of Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman, who were killed at Florida State University's Chi Omega sorority house. Bundy is later linked to the murder of Kimberly Leach, a 12-year-old girl whose body was found in a wooded area near Lake City, Florida.
          
          1979-1980: Bundy's legal proceedings drag on as he represents himself in court and files multiple appeals. He is eventually convicted of the murders of Levy and Bowman and sentenced to death. Bundy later confesses to several other murders and provides information on unsolved cases.
          
          1984-1989: Bundy's execution is delayed multiple times as he continues to file appeals and petitions. He is eventually executed in the electric chair on January 24, 1989, at Florida State Prison.
          
          The Ted Bundy case remains one of the most infamous and studied criminal cases in American history, with numerous books, documentaries, and films exploring Bundy's life and crimes.
