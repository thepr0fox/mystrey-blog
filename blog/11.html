 <h2>Early life</h2>
 <p>Thelma Alice Todd, born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, was the daughter of John Shaw Todd and Alice Elizabeth Edwards. She was a bright student and had plans to become a schoolteacher. After graduating from high school in 1923, she enrolled at the Lowell Normal School, where she earned money as a model and participated in beauty pageants. Her beauty caught the attention of Elks Lodge 65, which crowned her Miss Lawrence in 1925 and later Miss Massachusetts of the same year. While representing her state, a talent scout from Hollywood spotted her and offered her a spot at the Paramount Players School in New York City, where she received training in acting, diction, athletics, and manners.</p>

Todd also worked with Wheeler and Woolsey and Laurel and Hardy in several films, with her final appearance being in The Bohemian Girl. However, her promising career was cut short by her sudden death at the young age of 29.</p>

<h2>The Mysterious Death of Thelma Todd: A Tale of Hollywood Glamour and Tragedy</h2>
<p>The death of Thelma Todd is a story that has long captivated Hollywood and the public at large. On the morning of December 16, 1935, Todd's body was discovered slumped behind the wheel of her car in the garage of her restaurant, The Sidewalk Cafe, in Pacific Palisades, California. She was only 29 years old</p>
<p>The discovery of Todd's body was shrouded in mystery from the very beginning. When Todd failed to show up for a scheduled appointment, her chauffeur, Ernest Peters, went to check on her at the restaurant. When he arrived, he found the garage door open and Todd's car running, with the engine still running. Inside the car, Todd was slumped over the steering wheel, apparently unconscious. Peters immediately called the police.</p>
<p>When the police arrived on the scene, they found Todd's body in the car, her face covered in bruises and her nose broken. The initial assumption was that Todd had accidentally asphyxiated herself with the exhaust fumes from her car. However, the bruises on her face led the police to suspect foul play.</p>

<p>The investigation into Todd's death quickly became a media sensation, with rumors and theories flying left and right. Some speculated that Todd had been murdered by gangsters with ties to her business interests. Others suggested that Todd's ex-husband, Pat DiCicco, had been involved in her death. Still others speculated that Todd had been the victim of a jealous lover.</p>
<p>As the investigation continued, it became clear that Todd's death was not a simple case of accidental asphyxiation. An autopsy revealed that Todd had not died from carbon monoxide poisoning, but from a combination of alcohol and sleeping pills. The question then became whether Todd had committed suicide or had been murdered.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of concrete evidence, many people believed that Todd's death was the result of foul play. The fact that she had been in the process of breaking away from her business partner, Roland West, and had recently changed her will to leave him out, only added fuel to the fire. West himself was a suspect in the investigation, although he was never charged with any wrongdoing.</p>
